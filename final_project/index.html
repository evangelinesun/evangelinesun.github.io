    <p>
Iâ€™m a Chinese-born marketer with experience successfully developing and implementing social media campaigns and large-scale PR events in the U.S. and the UK. I have worked on projects in the fashion, media, and pharmaceutical industries. Whether working for a startup or a large global organization, I've taken on roles that demand skills in digital marketing, paid social, and data analytics. I have a talent for bringing in new ideas and executing them. </p>
